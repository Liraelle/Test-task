This is a test task REST API.
To realize that task I used Falsk.

The startup file is app.py. 
In db.py we creating SQLAlchemy object to easily put/get information in/from database.
This project contains two packages: resources and models.

In resources realized methods, which helps create and authorize users, create and see posts, like and unlike existing post, and analytics about how many likes was made on each post.
In models realized a simple ways to put, get and update information about users, post and likes in database.

For testing REST API I used Postman (v.7.28.0).
For writing this task I also used Python 3.7.
